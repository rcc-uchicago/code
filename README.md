# code

Place for sharing code among RCC staff, and with RCC users. *This
repository is currently private while it is in the trial phase. The
intent is to eventually make this repository public to facilitate code
sharing with RCC users.*

## Guidelines for contributing code

To contribute your code, clone the repository (`git clone ...`) add
your file to the git repository (`git add yourfile`), commit the file
(`git commit"`), and push the changes to github (`git push origin
master`). If the code is in multiple files, consider organizing the
files into a folder. Also make sure to update your local copy of the
repository once in a while (`git push origin master`).

Other important guidelines:

1. Please give your file (or folder) an informative name.

2. Add comments to the top of your file describing what the code does,
and how to use it.

3. If you have multiple files in a folder, please add a README (either
in plain text or in
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)).

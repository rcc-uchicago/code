# code

Place for sharing code among RCC staff, and with RCC users. This
repository is currently private while it is in trial phase.

## Guidelines for contributing code

To contribute your code, please add your file to the git repository
(`git add`), commit the file (`git commit`), and push the changes back
to github (`git push origin master`). If the code is in multiple
files, consider organizing the files into a folder.

Please give your file (or folder) an informative name, and add
comments to the top of your file describing what the code does, and
how to use it. If you have multiple files in a folder, please add a
README (either in plain text or Markdown).
